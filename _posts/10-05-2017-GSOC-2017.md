Every year our students compete in a fierce battle to spend quality summer time, despite the torturous Indian weather. The biggest destination is the Google Summer of Code, which has the very strong backing of the topmost companies increasing the brand value, gives you an invaluable chance to develop in open source, get the practical insights of open source development, and you get a fancy stipend as well!

Since the last couple of years we annually gave 2 selections to the program. I am happy to report 12 selections in the current edition of the program, which is an unprecedented growth in numbers. This is a very big boost for the open source community of the institute. The selected candidates are:

1. Diwakar Vinay (2nd yr) - [Moodle](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/organizations/5339870441504768/#5005300592541696)
